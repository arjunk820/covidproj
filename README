# Research Question

To what extent does demographic variables determine monthly death rates of
COVID-19?

## Initial Idea

I believe we're going to implement PCA in order to see the results
of the mathematical relationship between the deaths and demographic variables.

In addition, some analysis of the data at the beginning and with the main
variables considered.
